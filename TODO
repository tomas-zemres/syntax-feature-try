 - check/fix problems inside try/catch/finally block
    -> loop ops: next,last,redo

 - update stacktrace / caller ? 

 - test usage in different module that it is used

 - rewrite documentation to English ;)
 - check TODOs in source-code

 - set ( %Carp::Internal /  %Carp::CarpInternal ) to skip try/catch blocks
 - check if "die called from DESTROY" called at the end of "try block"
    does not break try/catch/finally handling
