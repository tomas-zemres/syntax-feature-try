 - croak if "return/wantarray" is called inside try/catch/finally block
    -> similar for next,last,redo
    -> later: implement return from subrutine inside try/catch/finally blocks

 - update stacktrace / caller ? 

 - test usage in different module that it is used

 - implement keyword "rethrow" or simple use die?
 - rewrite documentation to English ;)
 - check TODOs in source-code

 - split Try.xs to more small files

 - do not use DESTROY for "finally" block, because it is called in different
    see Try::Tiny (Try::Tiny::ScopeGuard->DESTROY)
    test die in DESTROY / finally
